00:00.660 --> 00:06.240
Something we're super excited about with coding for entrepreneurs is we have so much of our code available

00:06.540 --> 00:11.550
and open source on get dot com slash coding for entrepreneurs.

00:11.550 --> 00:17.530
So this is where the code currently resides for any of our projects or for the majority of our projects.

00:17.700 --> 00:22.800
So if you actually go into repositories you'll see the code that's related to our projects.

00:22.830 --> 00:27.900
We also have Guynn So these are helpful guides for installing all types of things that are related to

00:27.940 --> 00:30.560
coding French and coding in general.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.110
And so definitely check that out if you haven't seen it already.

00:35.310 --> 00:40.170
But as far as how you're going to use this code in your projects you're going to go ahead and click

00:40.170 --> 00:43.050
on one of your projects or whatever the project that you're working on.

00:43.050 --> 00:48.960
So in this case serve up membership as the project but we also have Gengel gap and 30 days a swift and

00:49.200 --> 00:50.280
so on and so forth.

00:50.280 --> 00:55.470
So you click on the project that you want to work with and then you'll look and see the various code

00:55.470 --> 00:56.310
that's related to it.

00:56.310 --> 01:02.350
So anything in here is the actual code that is most up to date.

01:02.350 --> 01:05.620
Right so it's going to be the most up to date code that you'll be able to use.

01:05.730 --> 01:10.230
And then if you scroll down you can see there's a section for lecture code and this can be true on most

01:10.230 --> 01:13.870
projects that actually have lectures instead of just one.

01:13.860 --> 01:18.990
If it's only one letter then it's not going to have lecture code obviously that will make sense when

01:18.990 --> 01:23.700
you're actually watching those projects because then you'll be able to take what's said in the video

01:24.000 --> 01:28.610
and look at the letter code itself.

01:28.650 --> 01:30.000
After that video is done.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.660
So what I mean is when you watch the log in required lecture It's called It's titled log in required

01:36.960 --> 01:39.670
and then the code is also titled log in required.

01:39.690 --> 01:44.280
So when you actually watch that lecture at the very end of it you can click on this one and it will

01:44.280 --> 01:46.670
show you whatever that code is.

01:46.830 --> 01:48.480
So that's got to be true for all of these.

01:48.480 --> 01:52.050
If you go to customize and integrate almost looks that's going to this is going to be the code that's

01:52.050 --> 01:54.870
done after that video is finished.

01:54.900 --> 01:59.970
So if you are in a point where let's say for instance you watched a bunch of them and for whatever reason

01:59.970 --> 02:03.920
you're getting stuck on one of the lectures and the code is just not clicking on your machine.

02:04.050 --> 02:10.110
It's just not working out well what you can do is you can either jump ahead and grab one of those codes

02:10.110 --> 02:16.650
and then kind of work backwards or you can just go to the next lecture possible and grab that code and

02:16.650 --> 02:18.100
then start it from there.

02:18.330 --> 02:22.290
Or even better you grab the most recent lecture that you finished.

02:22.290 --> 02:27.870
So I just finished custom user model part 1 and I went there and got in.

02:27.870 --> 02:29.100
Now I'm done with it.

02:29.100 --> 02:33.690
So I want to go ahead and click on this code and I'm going to download the zip file so if I download

02:33.690 --> 02:40.060
the zip it actually gives me this code related to this commit.

02:40.170 --> 02:45.660
So the commit has a tree up here so it actually takes me to a completely different area for the code.

02:45.690 --> 02:47.700
Now this has to do with hub and all that.

02:47.790 --> 02:54.390
But basically when you want to download any particular code you want to go based off of the commit version.

02:54.390 --> 02:56.870
So this tree appear and that's what these links are doing.

02:56.880 --> 03:00.350
Is that really just going to a tree of this commit version.

03:00.360 --> 03:06.810
So previous comments that we've made and being able to use that code itself.

03:06.810 --> 03:11.970
So if we double click on this code itself we'll see that if we come in here we have all this stuff that

03:11.970 --> 03:12.740
we would need.

03:12.900 --> 03:16.470
We have our source files we have source.

03:16.470 --> 03:23.970
We have a read me license our requirements that T x t and that's all the stuff that you would need to

03:23.970 --> 03:25.750
actually get your project started.

03:26.040 --> 03:29.820
And then also be able to check the code on your local computer as well.

03:29.820 --> 03:30.090
Right.

03:30.090 --> 03:36.300
So if we look into let's say counts and we look at our models IPY I can actually see this code and it

03:36.300 --> 03:38.420
doesn't matter what computer you're on.

03:38.580 --> 03:43.950
Now on a Mac I can preview just by pressing spacebar and I can see this code and this is actually what

03:43.950 --> 03:49.260
the code is right so that I can use this code and reference it against what I currently am using.

03:49.350 --> 03:52.360
Right because you might have made some errors or some issues and stuff like that.

03:52.530 --> 03:57.870
So one thing you will know about projects in particular if there's a migration folder and there's additional

03:57.870 --> 04:04.080
migrations in here that aren't on yours you can go ahead and ignore those and actually delete them.

04:04.140 --> 04:10.680
And then if you do delete any migrations delete this folder or the database and then start from scratch

04:10.680 --> 04:18.510
basically So run Python managed IPY sync DBI or Python managed up why make migrations So that is just

04:18.510 --> 04:21.060
a little bit about the get Hub's stuff.

04:21.060 --> 04:27.890
Granted we will have actual videos on polling a project from good hub and that using that project itself.

04:27.900 --> 04:32.610
But I did want to mention at least while you're going through these these videos that you can actually

04:32.640 --> 04:36.800
click on any of these lectures and compare it against yours.

04:36.810 --> 04:41.660
This is really good for troubleshooting one of the key tenets of getting better at code.

04:41.760 --> 04:44.970
After you understand how it all works by following what we do.

04:44.970 --> 04:50.160
The next part of it would be looking at code that you may have not seen in a while or have seen it all

04:50.800 --> 04:53.140
and actually trying to figure out what's going on.

04:53.160 --> 04:57.750
Right so if I go on to you or else I'll see you like the usual patterns that I have and I'll probably

04:57.750 --> 04:59.520
be able to do some stuff here.

04:59.620 --> 05:04.110
But that is something that you want to start practicing very early on.

05:04.110 --> 05:08.490
Actually check out the code so let's say for instance you finished this serve up project and you go

05:08.490 --> 05:12.750
into a repository and you want to check out one of the projects itself.

05:12.750 --> 05:18.570
So you go in the repository and you see let's say this e-commerce project or better yet let's see launch

05:18.570 --> 05:19.410
with code.

05:19.860 --> 05:25.530
We go in here and then you might want to just look at the code itself and get an idea of what's going

05:25.530 --> 05:25.830
on.

05:25.830 --> 05:30.540
What I do is I'll check out the settings and then I'm going to YOUR else to see how it's all mapped

05:30.540 --> 05:36.460
out so I can kind of see how the site actually works directly from you or else.

05:36.540 --> 05:41.770
Because if you remember or if you don't know this yet but you will soon or else is where it starts.

05:41.760 --> 05:46.470
But anyways so that's a little bit about the get hub I realized as an introduction so you probably aren't

05:46.470 --> 05:51.810
familiar with a lot of this material yet anyway but once you do get familiar this hub is going to be

05:51.810 --> 05:56.180
a great spot for you to get much better at the code itself.

05:56.340 --> 05:57.990
OK so if you have any questions let me know.

05:57.990 --> 05:59.140
Otherwise let's keep going.
