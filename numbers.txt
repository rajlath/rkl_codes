Every Even numbers can be expressed as sum of two primes numbers
12 7 + 5    14 3 + 11

Sum of two squares is a squares
9 + 16  25      64 + 36  100

TRIANGULAR numbers
Triangular Numbers are those numbers which are sum of a series of numbers
starting with 1
55  1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10

n th TRIANGULAR number is given by  (n * (n +1)) /2
eg. for 10   (10 + (10 + 1))/2

The sum of any two consecutive triangular numbers is a square

A positive integer of the form n(n + 1) is called oblong.
The nth oblong number is the sum of the first n even numbers

the sum of the first n odd numbers is n**2.

every positive number can be written as a sum of four or fewer squares

sum of the first n powers of 2 :  2*n -1

sum of the n powers of any number i  is  i ** n - 1  / a - 1

Whenever the sum of the first n powers of 2 is prime, this procedure yields a perfect number
is then called a Mersenne prime,

sum of the first n powers:
n*(n+1)*(2n+1)  / 6
